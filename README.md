# Codeforces-solutation-04

This repository contains my solutions for various Codeforces problems.  
This is the fourth set of my Codeforces problem-solving practice.

## Contents

- `Duplicate.cpp` — Solution for [problem description or link]  
- `Get Prefix Sum.cpp` — Solution for prefix sum related problems  
- `Insert it.cpp` — Solution for insertion related problems  
- `Printing X.cpp` — Solution for printing patterns (X pattern)  
- `Sorted.cpp` — Solution for sorting related problems

*(Feel free to update the descriptions and add problem links as you wish)*

## How to use

- Each `.cpp` file corresponds to a single Codeforces problem solution.  
- Compile and run the `.cpp` files using a C++ compiler, for example:

```bash
g++ Duplicate.cpp -o Duplicate && ./Duplicate

If you want, I can generate a `.gitignore` next (to ignore things like binaries, editor files, etc.) or help you add problem links to the file descriptions. Just ask!
